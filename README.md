# TETURISU!

A multiplayer web Tetris clone written in plain Typescript.

## Getting started

```sh
# Install dependencies first
npm install

# Bundle the game
# The 'public' folder can then be served as is
npm run build

# Try in development mode
# This will open a browser at 'localhost:8000'
npm run dev

# Run tests

npm run coverage
```

Teturisu uses rollup as bundler and jest as test framework.

## _Tetris Guideline_
